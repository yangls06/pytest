    "\n",
    "An array is a fundamental data structure available in most programming languages, and it has a wide range of uses across different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll take a look at array implementations in Python that use only core language features or functionality that’s included in the Python standard library. You’ll see the strengths and weaknesses of each approach so you can decide which implementation is right for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we jump in, let’s cover some of the basics first. How do arrays work, and what are they used for? Arrays consist of fixed-size data records that allow each element to be efficiently located based on its index:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual representation of an array\n",
    "Because arrays store information in adjoining blocks of memory, they’re considered contiguous data structures (as opposed to linked data structures like linked lists, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-world analogy for an array data structure is a parking lot. You can look at the parking lot as a whole and treat it as a single object, but inside the lot there are parking spots indexed by a unique number. Parking spots are containers for vehicles—each parking spot can either be empty or have a car, a motorbike, or some other vehicle parked on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not all parking lots are the same. Some parking lots may be restricted to only one type of vehicle. For example, a motor home parking lot wouldn’t allow bikes to be parked on it. A restricted parking lot corresponds to a typed array data structure that allows only elements that have the same data type stored in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance-wise, it’s very fast to look up an element contained in an array given the element’s index. A proper array implementation guarantees a constant O(1) access time for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes several array-like data structures in its standard library that each have slightly different characteristics. Let’s take a look."

    "\n",
    "A useful real-world analogy for a stack data structure is a stack of plates. New plates are added to the top of the stack, and because the plates are precious and heavy, only the topmost plate can be moved. In other words, the last plate on the stack must be the first one removed (LIFO). To reach the plates that are lower down in the stack, the topmost plates must be removed one by one.\n",

The list over-allocates its backing storage so that not every push or pop requires resizing. As a result, you get an amortized O(1) time complexity for these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside is that this makes their performance less consistent than the stable O(1) inserts and deletes provided by a linked list–based implementation (as you’ll see below with collections.deque).

For optimum performance, stacks based on Python lists should grow towards higher indexes and shrink towards lower ones.\n",

    "## Stack Implementations in Python: Summary\n",
    "As you’ve seen, Python ships with several implementations for a stack data structure. All of them have slightly different characteristics as well as performance and usage trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re not looking for parallel processing support (or if you don’t want to handle locking and unlocking manually), then your choice comes down to the built-in list type or collections.deque. The difference lies in the data structure used behind the scenes and overall ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "list is backed by a dynamic array, which makes it great for fast random access but requires occasional resizing when elements are added or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list over-allocates its backing storage so that not every push or pop requires resizing, and you get an amortized O(1) time complexity for these operations. But you do need to be careful to only insert and remove items using append() and pop(). Otherwise, performance slows down to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "collections.deque is backed by a doubly-linked list, which optimizes appends and deletes at both ends and provides consistent O(1) performance for these operations. Not only is its performance more stable, the deque class is also easier to use because you don’t have to worry about adding or removing items from the wrong end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, collections.deque is an excellent choice for implementing a stack (LIFO queue) in Python."

    "## Part 6. Queues (FIFOs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll see how to implement a **First-In/First-Out (FIFO)** queue data structure using only built-in data types and classes from the Python standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue is a collection of objects that supports fast FIFO semantics for inserts and deletes. The insert and delete operations are sometimes called enqueue and dequeue. Unlike lists or arrays, queues typically don’t allow for random access to the objects they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a real-world analogy for a FIFO queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a line of Pythonistas waiting to pick up their conference badges on day one of PyCon registration. As new people enter the conference venue and queue up to receive their badges, they join the line (enqueue) at the back of the queue. Developers receive their badges and conference swag bags and then exit the line (dequeue) at the front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to memorize the characteristics of a queue data structure is to think of it as a pipe. You add ping-pong balls to one end, and they travel to the other end, where you remove them. While the balls are in the queue (a solid metal pipe) you can’t get at them. The only way to interact with the balls in the queue is to add new ones at the back of the pipe (enqueue) or to remove them at the front (dequeue).\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are similar to stacks. The difference between them lies in how items are removed. With a queue, you remove the item least recently added (FIFO) but with a stack, you remove the item most recently added (LIFO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance-wise, a proper queue implementation is expected to take O(1) time for insert and delete operations. These are the two main operations performed on a queue, and in a correct implementation, they should be fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues have a wide range of applications in algorithms and often help solve scheduling and parallel programming problems. A short and beautiful algorithm using a queue is breadth-first search (BFS) on a tree or graph data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduling algorithms often use priority queues internally. These are specialized queues. Instead of retrieving the next element by insertion time, a priority queue retrieves the highest-priority element. The priority of individual elements is decided by the queue based on the ordering applied to their keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular queue, however, won’t reorder the items it carries. Just like in the pipe example, you get out what you put in, and in exactly that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python ships with several queue implementations that each have slightly different characteristics. Let’s review them."

    "A priority queue is a container data structure that manages a set of records with totally-ordered keys to provide quick access to the record with the smallest or largest key in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a priority queue as a modified queue. Instead of retrieving the next element by insertion time, it retrieves the highest-priority element. The priority of individual elements is decided by the order applied to their keys.\n",

    "Priority queues are commonly used for dealing with scheduling problems. For example, you might use them to give precedence to tasks with higher urgency.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ideally, higher-priority tasks on the system (such as playing a real-time game) should take precedence over lower-priority tasks (such as downloading updates in the background). By organizing pending tasks in a priority queue that uses task urgency as the key, the task scheduler can quickly select the highest-priority tasks and allow them to run first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll see a few options for how you can implement priority queues in Python using built-in data structures or data structures included in Python’s standard library. Each implementation will have its own upsides and downsides, but in my mind there’s a clear winner for most common scenarios. Let’s find out which one it is."
